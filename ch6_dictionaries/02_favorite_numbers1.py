"""Favorite Numbers:
Use a dictionary to store people’s favorite numbers. 
Think of five names, and use them as keys in your dictionary. 
Think of a favorite number for each person, and store each as a value in your dictionary. 
Print each person’s name and their favorite number. 
For even more fun, poll a few friends and get some actual data for your program.
