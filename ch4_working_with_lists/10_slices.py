"""Slices: 
Using one of the programs you wrote in this chapter, add several lines to the end of the program that do the following:
"""

char = ["A", "B", "C", "D", "E", "F", "G"]

# Print the message The first three items in the list are: Then use a slice to print the first three items from that programâ€™s list.
print(f"The first three items in the list are: {char[:3]}")

# Print the message Three items from the middle of the list are: Use a slice to print three items from the middle of the list.
print(f"The first three items in the list are: {char[2:5]}")

# Print the message The last three items in the list are: Use a slice to print the last three items in the list.
print(f"The first three items in the list are: {char[-3:]}")
